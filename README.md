**Origin, Destination and Distance TestGorilla's exercise validator.**

This is a Test Gorilla's code assessment validator.

The exercise consists of 4 Test Cases with a few more hidden Test Cases; these testcases are not shown here and you will have to populate manually on your first pull and run of the exercise.

Since there were some issues with the validation on this specific Code Assessment, I did a quick and dirty solution to help me validate candidates code resolution.

Pre-conditions:
1. As mentioned, you need to complement the valid result string for the hidden TestCases
2. You need to customize the scoring value per TestCase, I do a simple sum divided by number of TestCases. 

**To startup**

1. Create a class for the candidate that implements Tester interface
2. Add said class in the candidates list in Main class
3. Define the score per TestCase success
4. Run exercise.
